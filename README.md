## Project task
I wanted to build another portfolio website for a practice, I've found a design online that I liked and tried to make it look like that. I liked the desing since it had some JavaScript features I haven't used anywhere before and wanted to give it a try.

## Project overview
Overall project went pretty smoothly, only things that held me up a bit were JavaScript writing effect for which I utillized Typed.js in the end, and counter animation for numbers of clients, works etc. I had to do a little research about some new JS functions and managed to do it at the end. I also had some problems with the mobile nav menu on iPhones so I had to redesign that as well, now it looks a bit worse design-wise but works alright, had to make some compromises.
